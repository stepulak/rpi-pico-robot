# rpi-pico-robot

Micropython source code for my homemade DIY robot.

The robot consists of:
- four 6V DC motors
- two L9110S motor drivers
- Raspberry Pi Pico W (with wifi)
- five 1.2V NiMH cells for motors
- three 1.2V NiMH cells for RPI Pico

Robot creates a WiFi hotspot, to which you can connect with you mobile phone.
Open browser and go to `192.168.4.1:80`. Simple interface shows up to control this robot.

See source code for more details.
